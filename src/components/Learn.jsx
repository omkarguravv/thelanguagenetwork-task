                <p>You should remember that you can be ANY age and start learning a new language! The idea that there’s a cut-off point for language acquisition is incredibly common. People think that unless you learned a language when you were a child, there’s no hope and it’ll be near-impossible to grasp.

                    NEWSFLASH: That’s not the case! Learning French as an adult or young adult IS possible.  You CAN grasp a language, no matter your age. The difference between adults learning and children learning is that children are pretty much fearless when it comes to making mistakes. Did you know that language anxiety affects around a third of adult learners? Because many of us have this fear, there’s a risk we miss out on learning key French words and phrases.

                    So whether you’re 5 or 50, you can learn French easily by consistently practising! The best way to learn French is to be mindful of the fact that languages are about more than just vocabulary and grammar. Languages like French are built around people, culture, and connection. .</p>
